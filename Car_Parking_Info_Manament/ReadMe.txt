 
1)The name of every user is his/her password.
such as user arif's userID is : arif104 and his password is: arif

2) There is only one ADMIN  (userID:amin100  pass:amin) and ADMIN can  insert locations(nodes) and Update location's distance and time.
and the rest of the person are only user. 

3) Any user can search slot , update his info, delete his info, check rent status etc. the ADMIN can also do these and additionally he can do number 2. 


4) There are some limitation's and  i can not solve those because of abguious funtionality of MYSQLI_QUERY.
